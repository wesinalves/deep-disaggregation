## Repository for energy disaggregation using deep learning algorithms implemented in Keras library

Energy disaggregation is the a way to discover appliances power consumption from the aggregated power, which can be measured by single meter. 
Traditional algorithms for energy disaggregation, including those that use Deep Learning methods, applies univariate approaches. 
This work proposes a multivariate energy disaggregation approach using Deep Learning with the help of a secondary meter.
